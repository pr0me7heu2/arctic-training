Read in data file.

```{r}
catch_df <- read.csv(file = 'https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1',stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

head(catch_df)
```

* move from wide to long format

```{r}
catch_long <- catch_df %>%
  select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum) %>%
  gather(key = "species", value = "catch", -Year, -Region)



head(catch_long)
```


```{r}
catch_cleaned <- catch_long %>% 
  rename(catch_thousands = catch)

head(catch_cleaned)
